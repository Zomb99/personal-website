        <h2>Indoor Climbing</h2>
        <hr/>
        <p>Starting last year, I started going to the BRIC to climb the BroncoPeak
            (the climbing wall) and ever since have been hooked. There's something about 
            topping a climb you've been working on for awhile thats so satisfying. 
            While I'm not the best climber, I hope to slowly build up my strength and 
            technique to get better and better!
