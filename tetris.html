            I'm sure you're already aware of Tetris and everything its about. 
            You clear lines using blocks, pretty simple. But would you believe me 
            if I told you that millions of people around the world (me included)
             <em>play it competitively?</em>
        </h3>
        <p>It's True! Tetris has a really competitive community, all competing for 
            various titles. The main one is the 40L Sprint, where a player try to 
            clear 40 Lines as fast as possible! Here are some of the fastest times 
            in the world:

                <th>Player</th>
                <th>Time</th>
                <th>Pieces Per Second</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Lurny</td>

            </tr>
        </table>

        <details>The best players in the world are reallllllly
            fast, nearly twice as fast as me, and I'd consider 
            myself a pretty fast player, but placing <strong>7 pieces 
            per second</strong> is absolutely unbelievable! Here's a video 
            of Lurny's time, showing the insane pace of the record.
            Also, if you're actually reading this Ethan, if you send me 
            an email about Tetris I'll make you brownies one day :)
